									<p>Played a pivotal role in designing and implementing a cutting-edge Online E-Commerce System on Cloud Infrastructure, with a primary focus on scalability and security. As the lead architect, I utilized Microsoft Azure and Lucidchart to craft the system's architecture, incorporating my deep knowledge of Azure services. To bolster data protection, I implemented robust security measures, including Azure Active Directory B2C and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Additionally, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of industry-specific risk factors and budgetary considerations, ensuring a seamless and cost-effective transition to cloud infrastructure. If you're interested in cloud-based e-commerce solutions, secure architecture design, and leveraging Microsoft Azure for business scalability, this project provides valuable insights into these achievements.

										<h2><a href="#">Artificial Intelligence Project – Prediction of logP</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, I leveraged my Python programming skills and focused on using key libraries like Scikit-learn to develop machine learning models. The primary goal was to predict the important chemical property, logP, based on various chemical descriptors. Specifically, I implemented the Random Forest Regressor, Gaussian Process Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor algorithms.

										Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation, I systematically assessed the performance of these three regressor models in predicting logP. All of this work is meticulously documented in a Jupyter Notebook, providing clear insights into the practical applications of machine learning, Python programming, and their relevance in addressing real-world challenges in the field of chemoinformatics.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Artificial Intelligence Project – Prediction of Resale Flat Price</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										In this project, I delved into a dataset to uncover trends and correlations using data visualization techniques. Subsequently, I harnessed machine learning tools like Ridge Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Decision Tree Regressor for both predicting resale prices and classifying flat types based on available variables.
